# crypto-tax-calculator

Personal cryptocurrency tax calculator for Japan's miscellaneous income. This is a rough project that I've did for myself while studying react/nextjs and nosql for the first time, so it may not work correctly...

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
